                        1. What does the video tell you? <br><br>

                        It tells us that we should have more confidence in ourselves. People may belittle us for what we have, but we should not listen to them because it can only affect our mental health and lead to depression or low self-esteem. Also, he reminds us just to be ourselves. We should always be content with everything we have, even if some things aren't the same with other people and they look better with the things/ body you are always insecure with. Never bully a person for their situation, especially disabled people. It's not their choice to have that body, they didn't want to have that, but they cannot do anything with it. We should consider their feelings and never judge their situations because they are human beings who try to live in this chaotic world. Even though some of us were born differently, it shows bravery and courage that we must have confidence in our own abilities and knowledge. Because life is a gift from God and since each person has their own unique talents, skills, and abilities that they should be encouraged to use, we don't need to compare ourselves to others. Disability is nothing to be ashamed of, however you should be grateful that you can still live your life. <br><br>
                        
                        
                        2. What is the message you get from the video? <br><br>
                        
                        He encourages us always to look forward, and we should accept that we may not be able to see our path right now, but that doesn't mean it's not there. "There are some things in life that it's out of our control and that we can't change, but we would have to live with it." Let's accept all the flaws and imperfections in life. We don't always get good things, sometimes, we are also made to experience things we don't like, and that's where the learning comes from. Let's accept that our wants will not happen, and not everything we want to happen will happen because there are other things that Jesus wants to give us that are even better. We need to be strong and overcome any challenges we encounter in life. You alone can succeed if you desire to accomplish something in your life; we don't need anyone else to push us. Don't think of yourself as a failure, otherwise, you'll be unable to face your fears and the obstacles in your path. Make those negative comments a source of motivation for yourself. Because having a disability is not something you can choose, if you are disabled, accept your flaws and live your life with confidence and joy. <br><br>
                         
                        3. How do you apply the announcement of the video to your life? <br><br>
                        
                        I'll motivate myself to confront challenges and overcome over my struggles. I will think back to the difficulties I overcame and remind myself that with God, anything is possible. ready to stand up for your life, path, and happiness and fight back against the things that make you discouraged. Nick is a true inspiration to those of us who were born with arms and legs because of the way he overcame all of the obstacles in his life to achieve the things he desired.

It lays out a clear course for my education and personal growth, emphasizing a Christ-centered approach and a dedication to social transformation. The emphasis on acquiring a top-notch education that is rooted in faith strikes a chord with me more than any other component of the mission and vision statement. HCDC understands the value of developing a profound knowledge of and connection with God in addition to academic learning. My values, beliefs, and spirituality have a strong foundation thanks to the focus placed on religious education. It really inspires me to investigate and grow in my faith, incorporating it into every aspect of my life as I continue my educational journey.
                        <br><br>
                        Moreover, the mission and vision statement emphasize the importance of pursuing excellence and holiness. The school strives to create a culture of excellence where students are encouraged to excel personally, academically, and professionally. This pursuit of excellence is not detached from our spiritual growth but is intertwined with it. HCDC recognizes that true excellence encompasses character development, integrity, and a strong moral compass. This holistic approach instills in me a sense of responsibility to constantly strive for personal and academic growth, while also upholding strong moral values. As a freshman, I am grateful to be a part of the HCDC community that upholds these values and provides a supportive environment for my growth. The college's commitment to a human and Christian learning environment fosters an atmosphere where I feel nurtured and empowered to develop as a whole person.
                        <br><br>
                        In conclusion, the HCDC's purpose and vision statements have been a source of inspiration for me as a freshman. It serves as a reminder of the value of a Christian education, the necessity of societal change, and the importance of striving for excellence and holiness. Knowing that I am a member of a community that appreciates academic success as well as pushes me to develop into a caring person and a force for good in society makes me eager to continue my education at HCDC.

                        Natural and man-made calamities can change our lives forever in the blink of an eye. My family has been through both fires and earthquakes, which have put our strength and perseverance to the test. <br> <br>

                        During the epidemic, a tiny fire started by a neighbor threatened to consume our house. Fortunately, our community banded together to put out the fires, limiting the damage but leaving noticeable scars on our walls and drapes. An earthquake struck shortly after, unsettling our confidence. In the middle of the commotion, I prioritized the protection of my beloved pets, even if it meant placing myself in danger. My mother found this humorous at first, but she soon realized the depth of my attachment to my animal pals. <br> <br>

                        We remain unified in the face of adversity, ready to meet whatever difficulties come our way. The scars may fade, but the memory of those who assisted us will live on in our hearts forever. <br><br>

                        The Care for Mother Earth <br><br>

                        The astonishing variety of ecosystems on the planet we call home, Earth, support life in all of its richness. It is our innate responsibility to look after Mother Earth as guardians of this fragile equilibrium. It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of protecting the environment because both current and future generations' quality of life directly depends on the condition of our planet.
                        <br><br>
                        Sustainable lifestyle choices that reduce our ecological footprint are essential to taking care of Mother Earth. This entails minimizing waste, preserving energy, and advancing renewable resources. Reusing, replanting, and practicing responsible consumption are essential measures in reducing the negative effects of human activity on the environment.
                        <br><br>
                        Furthermore, understanding the complicated relationships between different species and ecosystems creates a greater appreciation of the wonder and complexity of our planet. By promoting biodiversity, we protect the underpinnings of life's intricate web, which in turn protects our existence.
                        <br><br>
                        A culture of environmental consciousness can only be fostered with the help of education. Teaching the next generation about ecosystems, climate change, and the need for preservation instills values that will endure throughout time.
                        <br><br>
                        Finally, I would want to emphasize that protecting Mother Earth is a responsibility that we must all assume. To maintain a sustainable and peaceful cohabitation with the rest of the world, every activity, no matter how tiny, contribute to our collective effort. Recognizing our interconne

                        The Holy Cross of Davao College (HCDC) is a Catholic institution dedicated to forming a community of believers and evangelizers committed to truth, education, and the creation of a more compassionate world. They place a premium on offering high-quality Catholic education as well as cultivating excellence and holiness. They also aim to foster a human and Christian learning environment conducive to social reform. <br><br>

                        The spirituality of HCDC is built on engaging with God as a way of life. Stewardship is stressed, with individuals being called to live virtuous lives, mature as followers of Jesus, and bring others closer to God. Conservation, living a basic lifestyle, campaigning for ecological, practicing spiritual discipline, and accepting co-responsibility are all examples of values. <br> <br>
                        
                        HCDC's basic values are Truth, Justice, Peace, Service, and Wisdom. Truth is regarded as the highest achievement since it entails the discovery of God. Justice is regarded as the highest consciousness, calling people to be just and agents of justice. The greatest source of inspiration is peace, which is attributed to God. The biggest obligation is to encourage people to become servant-leaders and followers of Jesus Christ. Finally, Wisdom is the most significant commitment, as it requires building a right relationship with God. <br> <br>
